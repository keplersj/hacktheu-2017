# NEAT Life @ [HackTheU 2017](https://hacktheu.com/)
This year's theme for HackTheU is Machine Learning/AI and I will be working to make a program which uses  a machine learning model to create complex and interesting instances patterns in Conway's Game of Life.

## Prior Art

This project is inspired by many existing pieces of art already in the field. Among them includes:

Conway's Game of Life:
